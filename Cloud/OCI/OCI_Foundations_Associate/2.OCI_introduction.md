## OCI Architecutre 

### OCI Levles ??

- Regions
    - Availability Domains **AD** 
        - Fault Domains **FD**

> How To Choose a Region 
    - Location `place colse to your users`
    - Data Residency and Compliance `strict data`
    - Service Availability `Cloud Service`

> Availability Domains
    - any Region contains 3 `AD` 
    - isolated from each other 
    - Physical Infrastructure not shared 
        - Fault Domains
            - any `AD` contains 3 `FD` 
            - Logical Data Center Within an `AD`
            - Resources placed in different **FD** will not share single points of Hardware failuer ??

    - `AD` > Proctect Single Point of failuer `FD`
    - `Regin` > At least 2 Datacenter 

> `SLA(Service level of agreement)` on Availability, Managment, and Performance
